<!-- SLOT 3: Recap + open wound -->

# Last Time, This Time

- **Module 6 delivered:** routes that reroute themselves automatically around failures
- **It left broken:** nothing stops an unauthorized source from reaching a vulnerable service in the first place

---

<!-- SLOT 4: The pain -->

# One Open Port, One Death

<div class="pain">

In 2020, a ransomware attack on a hospital forced the redirect of
emergency patients - one patient died during the delay. Attackers entered
through a remote-access server with no traffic restrictions: any address
could connect and exploit it. Routing got them there; nothing stopped them.

</div>

---

<!-- SLOT 5: Cost of not knowing -->

# What This Actually Costs

- Without traffic filtering, "reachable" and "authorized" mean the same thing - which they should never mean
- One exposed service becomes the entry point for an entire network compromise

<div class="why">
<strong>In industry:</strong> ACLs are the most widely deployed traffic-filtering tool in the world - in every corporate router, every ISP core, every campus network.
</div>

---

<!-- SLOT 6: Driving question -->
<!-- _class: section -->

# This Module's Question

<div class="driving-q">"How do you let the traffic you want through, and nothing else?"</div>

---

<!-- SLOT 7: Learning outcomes -->

# By the End of This Module, You Can

1. Explain standard vs extended ACLs, when to use each
2. Write numbered and named ACL rules with wildcard masks
3. Apply an ACL to the correct interface and direction
4. Debug a misconfigured ACL by reading hit counts

---

<!-- SLOT 8: Origin -->

# Where This Idea Came From

Access control lists originate from Unix file-permission concepts of the
1970s, adapted by router vendors in the late 1980s into packet filtering -
years before dedicated firewall appliances existed. For most of networking
history, the router's ACL *was* the firewall.

---

<!-- SLOT 9: Core concept -->

# ACL Processing: Definition

> Rules are evaluated **top to bottom**; the first match wins. If no rule
> matches: **implicit deny all**. A **standard** ACL matches source IP
> only; an **extended** ACL matches source, destination, protocol, and
> port.

| Property | Standard | Extended |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Matches on | Source IP only | Source, Dest, Protocol, Port |
| Best placed | Close to **destination** | Close to **source** |

---

<!-- Act 3 / BUILD -->

# Wildcard Masks

| Wildcard | Matches |
|----------|---------|
| `0.0.0.0` | Exactly one host (`host` keyword) |
| `0.0.0.255` | All hosts in a /24 |
| `255.255.255.255` | All addresses (`any` keyword) |

A wildcard `1` bit means "don't care" - the inverse of a subnet mask.

---

# The Implicit Deny Trap

Every ACL ends with an unwritten **implicit deny all**. Removing your
explicit `permit ip any any` line doesn't remove one rule - it exposes that
implicit deny, and **all** traffic through that interface stops, not just
the traffic you meant to block.

---

<!-- SLOT N-2: Worked example -->

# Guided Lab at a Glance

**Part A** - standard ACL: restrict server access to one subnet, applied outbound closest to destination

**Part B** - extended ACL: permit ICMP but block HTTP from one host, applied inbound closest to source

**Part C** - named ACL + debugging: deliberately remove `permit any` and observe everything break

---

<!-- SLOT N-1: Common mistakes -->

# Common Mistakes

- **Forgetting the final permit:** without it, the implicit deny blocks
  everything, not just the traffic you intended to filter
- **Placing an extended ACL far from the source:** it still works, but
  wastes bandwidth carrying traffic across the network only to drop it
  later

---

<!-- SLOT N: Check yourself -->

# Check Yourself

1. What wildcard mask matches *exactly one host*? What matches *all hosts*?
2. What happens to a packet that does not match any ACL entry?

---

# Answers

1. `0.0.0.0` (or the `host` keyword) matches one host; `255.255.255.255` (or `any`) matches all
2. It is dropped - the implicit deny all at the end of every ACL

---

<!-- SLOT N+1: Limits -->

# What ACLs Cannot Do

<div class="limits">
ACLs filter Layer 3 traffic between subnets. But they can't stop a
broadcast storm inside one flat Layer 2 network - an ACL never even sees
traffic that never needed to be routed in the first place.
</div>

---

<!-- SLOT N+2: Bridge -->

# Next Module

<!-- Week 8 is the midterm - no deck, no chain link here -->

Module 7 leaves **Layer 2 broadcast isolation** unsolved. **Module 9**
(after the Week 8 midterm) addresses it: VLANs.

---

<!-- SLOT N+3: Summary -->

# Summary

- Filtering is not the same as routing - reachable ≠ authorized
- The implicit deny is the most common ACL authoring trap
- **Deliverables & assessment:** standard + extended + named ACL screenshots
  with hit counts, implicit-deny explanation - see the book for the full
  rubric
