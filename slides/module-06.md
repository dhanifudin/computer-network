<!-- SLOT 3: Recap + open wound -->

# Last Time, This Time

- **Module 5 delivered:** working static routes between two or three sites
- **It left broken:** a link failure at 3 AM still requires a human to log in and fix every affected router by hand

---

<!-- SLOT 4: The pain -->

# One Misconfiguration, Global Outage

<div class="pain">

A university campus has 40 buildings; a national ISP has hundreds of
routers. If a link goes down at 3 AM, someone must log into each affected
router and manually update routes — or the affected sites stay isolated
until morning. In 2021, a single routing misconfiguration took down
Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus worldwide for six hours.

</div>

---

<!-- SLOT 5: Cost of not knowing -->

# What This Actually Costs

- Manual route maintenance doesn't scale past a handful of sites
- A single bad update can propagate and remove reachability everywhere at once

<div class="why">
<strong>In industry:</strong> understanding how dynamic routing propagates and fails is what separates "the internet went down" postmortems that get fixed in minutes from ones that take hours.
</div>

---

<!-- SLOT 6: Driving question -->
<!-- _class: section -->

# This Module's Question

<div class="driving-q">"How does a network route around a failure without a human logging in first?"</div>

---

<!-- SLOT 7: Learning outcomes -->

# By the End of This Module, You Can

1. Explain the difference between distance-vector and link-state routing
2. Configure RIPv2 on multiple routers and verify route propagation
3. Configure EIGRP and compare its convergence speed to RIP
4. Simulate a link failure and observe automatic reconvergence

---

<!-- SLOT 8: Origin -->

# Where This Idea Came From

RIP traces back to Xerox PARC's routing work in the late 1970s, formalized
as an internet standard in **RFC 1058 (1988)** — simple, but limited to 15
hops by design, to prevent routing loops from running forever. **EIGRP**
(Cisco, 1994) built on distance-vector research from SRI International's
DUAL algorithm to converge far faster while staying easy to configure.

---

<!-- SLOT 9: Core concept -->

# Distance-Vector Routing: Definition

> A **distance-vector** protocol shares its own routing table with directly
> connected neighbors, who add their own cost and pass it on — routers
> learn the network gradually, hop by hop, without ever seeing the full
> topology.

| Property | RIP | EIGRP |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Metric | Hop count | Composite (BW, delay, reliability) |
| Max hops | 15 | 255 |
| Updates | Periodic, 30s | Triggered |
| Convergence | Slow | Fast |

---

<!-- Act 3 / BUILD -->

# Configuration Patterns

**RIPv2** (classful network statements):
```
router rip
 version 2
 network <classful-network>
 no auto-summary
```

**EIGRP** (wildcard mask, AS number must match on all routers):
```
router eigrp <AS-number>
 network <network> <wildcard-mask>
 no auto-summary
```

---

# Why EIGRP Converges Faster

EIGRP's **DUAL algorithm** pre-computes **feasible successors** — backup
routes that are loop-free and ready before a failure happens. RIP has no
such backup — it waits for the next periodic update (up to 30s) to detect
a dead route.

---

<!-- SLOT N-2: Worked example -->

# Guided Lab at a Glance

**Part A** — three-router topology, configure RIPv2, verify `R` entries and connectivity

**Part B** — verify with `show ip protocols`; simulate a link failure, time RIP's reconvergence

**Part C** — replace RIP with EIGRP (matching AS number); compare `D` entries and reconvergence time

---

<!-- SLOT N-1: Common mistakes -->

# Common Mistakes

- **Forgetting `no auto-summary`:** without it, RIP/EIGRP summarize at
  classful boundaries, breaking routing across discontiguous subnets
- **Mismatched EIGRP AS numbers:** routers with different AS numbers never
  form a neighbor relationship — no error, just silence

---

<!-- SLOT N: Check yourself -->

# Check Yourself

1. What metric does RIP use to determine the best path? What metric does EIGRP use?
2. What is "convergence" in a dynamic routing context?

---

# Answers

1. RIP uses hop count; EIGRP uses a composite metric based on bandwidth, delay, and reliability
2. The process by which all routers in a network reach a consistent, up-to-date view of reachable routes after a topology change

---

<!-- SLOT N+1: Limits -->

# What Dynamic Routing Cannot Do

<div class="limits">
RIP and EIGRP now find alternate paths automatically when a link fails.
But nothing here stops an unauthorized source from reaching a vulnerable
service in the first place — routing gets a packet somewhere; it doesn't
ask whether it should.
</div>

---

<!-- SLOT N+2: Bridge -->

# Next Module

Module 6 leaves **traffic filtering** unaddressed. **Module 7** addresses
it: Access Control Lists.

---

<!-- SLOT N+3: Summary -->

# Summary

- Dynamic routing automates what static routing did by hand
- EIGRP's pre-computed backups converge faster than RIP's wait-and-detect
- **Deliverables & assessment:** routing tables for both protocols, link
  failure convergence comparison — see the book for the full rubric
