# Module 2 - Network Review 1 & Packet Tracer Intro

## Why This Matters

When a junior engineer says "the network is down," what do they mean? Usually it means one application on one machine stopped working. But is the problem at Layer 1 (is the cable plugged in?), Layer 3 (is the IP wrong?), Layer 4 (is the port blocked?), or Layer 7 (is the web server down)? The OSI and TCP/IP models exist not as textbook abstractions but as a **diagnostic checklist**: if you can ping by IP but not by name, the problem is at the DNS layer, not IP. If you can't ping at all, check lower. This systematic, layer-by-layer thinking is what separates engineers who fix problems from ones who guess. This module makes that thinking concrete by letting you **watch packets move layer by layer** in Packet Tracer's Simulation Mode.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab, students are able to:

1. Describe the function of each OSI layer and map it to the corresponding TCP/IP layer.
2. Use Packet Tracer Simulation Mode to observe protocol encapsulation and decapsulation.
3. Identify which protocols operate at which layers using packet capture in PT.
4. Trace a complete HTTP request from browser to server, naming each protocol envelope added and removed at each hop.

## Pre-Lab

**Read before class:** Supplementary textbook, Chapter 2 (Network Models); reference module - Modul Teori Jarkom-2 (Protokol dan Model Jaringan).

**Answer before the session:**

1. List the seven OSI layers (number and name) from top to bottom.
2. Which two OSI layers does the TCP/IP Application layer correspond to?
3. What is encapsulation? Describe it in one sentence without using the word "wrap."
4. A frame is received by a switch. Does the switch look at the IP header? Why or why not?
5. What is the PDU (Protocol Data Unit - the name for a chunk of data at a given layer) at each layer (bit, frame, packet, segment, data/message)?

## Estimated Time (In-Class Lab, ~2 hrs)

| Phase | Time |
|-------|------|
| Part A: OSI review topology | 20 min |
| Part B: Simulation Mode - ICMP | 25 min |
| Part C: Simulation Mode - HTTP | 30 min |
| Challenge / wrap-up | 15 min |

*Guided Lab activities above run about 90 minutes - the rest of the 2-hour block covers troubleshooting, Challenge Tasks, and lab-report writeup.*

## Theory Review

The **OSI model** has 7 layers; the **TCP/IP model** has 4. Each layer adds a **header** (and sometimes a trailer) to the data handed down from above - this is **encapsulation**. At the receiving end, each layer strips its header and passes the remainder up - **decapsulation**.

| OSI | TCP/IP | PDU | Key Protocols |
|-----|--------|-----|---------------|
| Application (7) | Application | Data | HTTP, DNS, SMTP, FTP, Telnet |
| Presentation (6) | Application | Data | TLS/SSL, JPEG, ASCII |
| Session (5) | Application | Data | NetBIOS, RPC |
| Transport (4) | Transport | Segment | TCP, UDP |
| Network (3) | Internet | Packet | IP, ICMP, ARP |
| Data Link (2) | Network Access | Frame | Ethernet, PPP, Wi-Fi |
| Physical (1) | Network Access | Bit | Cables, signals, NIC |

> **NIC** = Network Interface Card, the hardware a device's IP address is bound to - what "PC0's interface" refers to in the addressing table below.

A **switch** operates at Layer 2: it reads the destination MAC address in the Ethernet frame and forwards it to the correct port - it never looks at the IP header. A **router** operates at Layer 3: it strips the Ethernet frame, reads the IP destination, makes a routing decision, and re-encapsulates into a new Ethernet frame for the next hop. Understanding this explains why routing is needed between subnets but not within them.

This is the mechanism that makes layer-by-layer troubleshooting possible: each device is only responsible for its own layer.

## Guided Lab

### Part A - Build the Review Topology

Construct the following three-subnet topology. Use the exact IP addresses shown - you will need them for later modules.

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group lan1(net:cloud)[LAN 1]
    group lan2(net:cloud)[LAN 2]

    service pc0(net:pc)[PC0] in lan1
    service pc1(net:pc)[PC1] in lan1
    service sw0(net:switch)[Switch0] in lan1
    service r0(net:router)[Router0]
    service sw1(net:switch)[Switch1] in lan2
    service pc2(net:pc)[PC2] in lan2

    pc0:R -- L:sw0
    pc1:R -- L:sw0
    sw0:R -- L:r0
    r0:R -- L:sw1
    sw1:R -- L:pc2
```

Device addressing:

| Device | Interface | IP Address | Subnet Mask | Gateway |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|---------|
| PC0 | NIC | 192.168.1.10 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.1.1 |
| PC1 | NIC | 192.168.1.20 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.1.1 |
| Router0 | Fa0/0 | 192.168.1.1 | 255.255.255.0 | - |
| Router0 | Fa0/1 | 192.168.2.1 | 255.255.255.0 | - |
| PC2 | NIC | 192.168.2.10 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.2.1 |

> **Fa0/0** = FastEthernet0/0, the router's first FastEthernet interface - Cisco's interface-naming shorthand (type + slot/port). This abbreviated form recurs in every addressing table from here on. **LAN 1** / **LAN 2** in the diagram above are each a Local Area Network - a network confined to one side of the router.

> **Note:** We will configure the router interfaces in Module 3. For now, PCs on the **same switch** should be able to ping each other; cross-router pings will fail - and that is expected and intentional.

**Step 1.** Place devices: 2× PC-PT, 1× Cisco 2960 switch, 1× Cisco 1841 router (or 2811), 1× more 2960 switch, 1× more PC-PT.

**Step 2.** Cable: PCs to switches with **Copper Straight-Through**; switches to router with **Copper Straight-Through** (switch-to-router is unlike devices).

**Step 3.** Configure PC0 and PC1 IP addresses as shown. Leave the gateway field filled in (it won't work yet, but enter it now).

**Step 4.** Ping test: from PC0, ping PC1.

📸 Screenshot the successful same-subnet ping.

> **Observe:** Does the ping from PC0 to PC2 (192.168.2.10) succeed? Why not? What is missing?

### Part B - ICMP in Simulation Mode

![Schematic diagram of Packet Tracer's Simulation Mode: the workspace with a packet mid-hop, the Event List panel with sample ARP and ICMP rows, and the Play / Next / Auto Capture / Reset Simulation controls](images/pt-simulation-mode.svg)

**Step 5.** Switch to **Simulation Mode** (clock icon, bottom right). Set the Event List filter to show only **ICMP** and **ARP**.

**Step 6.** From PC0's command prompt, send a single ping to PC1: `ping 192.168.1.20 -n 1` (Windows PT syntax).

**Step 7.** Click **Play** and then **Auto Capture / Play** or step through manually using **Next**. Watch each event in the Event List.

📸 Screenshot the event list showing the ARP request/reply followed by ICMP echo/reply.

> **Observe:** Which happened first - ARP or ICMP? Why must ARP happen first?

**Step 8.** Click on any ICMP event and open the PDU information (click the envelope icon). Identify:

- Source and destination MAC (Layer 2)
- Source and destination IP (Layer 3)
- ICMP type and code (Layer 3 / ICMP)

> **Explain:** At which layers does the switch read headers? At which layers does the PC's NIC read headers?

---

### Part C - HTTP in Simulation Mode

**Step 9.** Add a **Server-PT** to the topology, connected to Switch1 with a straight-through cable.

- Server IP: `192.168.2.100 / 255.255.255.0`, gateway `192.168.2.1`
- Click the server → **Services** tab → **HTTP** → verify it is **On**.

**Step 10.** On PC0, open **Desktop → Web Browser**. In the URL bar type: `http://192.168.2.100`

> The page will fail - the router is not configured. This is the "problem" state. Note it and move on.

**Step 11.** In Simulation Mode, set the filter to show: **DNS, TCP, HTTP, ARP, ICMP**. Send the HTTP request again from PC0.

📸 Screenshot the event list showing the sequence of protocols involved.

> **List in order** the protocol events you observe (e.g. ARP → TCP SYN → HTTP GET…). For each, state which layer it belongs to.

---

### Part D - ARP Cause and Effect

This exercise demonstrates why ARP must precede any IP communication - and why running the same command twice can give different output.

**Step 12.** On PC0's Desktop → Command Prompt, check the current ARP cache:

```
PC0> arp -a
```

📸 Screenshot. The table is likely empty or minimal (no entry for PC1's IP yet).

**Step 13.** Ping PC1 once:

```
PC0> ping 192.168.1.20 -n 1
```

**Step 14.** Run `arp -a` again immediately:

```
PC0> arp -a
```

📸 Screenshot. You should now see an entry for 192.168.1.20 with a MAC address.

> **Answer this question:** You ran `arp -a` twice with no configuration change in between. Why did the two outputs differ?
> *(Hint: the ping in Step 13 triggered an ARP broadcast - your PC had to discover PC1's MAC before it could send the ICMP Echo Request. Once ARP received a reply, it cached the MAC. The second `arp -a` shows that cached entry.)*

**Step 15.** In Simulation Mode, filter for **ARP and ICMP only**, then send the same ping. Step through the events.

📸 Screenshot of the Event List showing the ARP broadcast (Ethernet destination FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF), ARP reply (unicast), and then ICMP Echo Request.

> **Observe:** ARP is a Layer 2 broadcast. Every device on the local segment receives it. Only the device that owns the target IP replies. This is why ARP works within a subnet but cannot cross a router (routers do not forward broadcasts).

## Challenge Tasks

1. **Wireshark companion (real machine):** Open Wireshark, start a capture on your active interface, then open a webpage in your browser. Stop the capture and find: (a) the DNS query/response, (b) the TCP three-way handshake, (c) the HTTP GET request. Screenshot all three and annotate the layer for each.
2. In PT Simulation Mode, find the exact moment the Ethernet frame changes its **source and destination MAC** as a packet passes through the router. Which MAC is used on each segment? What does this tell you about how routers work at Layer 2?
3. Add a second router (Router1) between Router0 and Switch1. Explore what happens to the event count in the simulation list. Does the number of ARP events change? Why?
4. **Personalized subnetting drill:** Take the IP address `10.10.XX.YY/24` where XX = the last two digits of your student ID and YY = 40 + your roll number in class (e.g., student ID 2023-0042, roll number 5 → `10.10.42.45/24`). Calculate: (a) the network address, (b) the broadcast address, (c) the first and last usable host addresses, (d) total usable hosts. Then find a classmate and compare your network addresses - do your addresses fall in the same /24 network? In the same /16? At what prefix length do you first land in the *same* network?
