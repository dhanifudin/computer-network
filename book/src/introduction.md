*Prefer PDF? Every chapter of this manual is also released individually - see the [chapter PDF index](pdf/). Unfamiliar abbreviation in a lab step? Check the [Glossary](appendix/glossary.md) - it works standalone, chapter by chapter. Want extra practice beyond the weekly labs? See [Appendix F](appendix/resources.md).*

## Course Goal

Students will be able to **build and operate computer networks** using Cisco Packet Tracer. The course builds directly on your prior Computer Networks course - you already understand the theory; here you implement, observe failures, and fix them.

By the end of the semester, you will have designed and presented a complete simulated network from scratch, integrating multiple technologies covered in the weekly labs.

## Teaching Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Lecture (강의) | Brief concept intro at the start of each session |
| Lab Practice (실험·실습) | Hands-on Packet Tracer guided labs - the majority of class time |
| PBL (Problem-Based Learning) | Each module begins with a real-world problem your configuration must solve |
| Capstone Design | Weeks 13–14: design, build, and present a complete network project |

## Class Format

Each weekly session is **3 × 50-minute periods (150 minutes total)**:

| Segment | Duration | Material |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Lecture: concept & theory | ~1 hour | Slide deck - see [Lecture Slides](../slides/intro.html) |
| Hands-on lab: guided practice | ~2 hours | This book's Guided Lab (Parts A–D below) |

The lecture covers *Why This Matters*, *Learning Outcomes*, and *Theory Review* before the lab begins - the module pages below assume that context going in. Guided Lab activities in each module run roughly 90 minutes; the remaining time in the 2-hour block covers troubleshooting, Challenge Tasks, and lab-report writeup.

## Grading

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Attendance (출석) | 10% |
| Midterm Exam (중간평가) - Week 8 | 30% |
| Final Exam (기말평가) - Week 15 | 30% |
| Lab Reports / Assignments (과제) | 10% |
| Other (project, participation) | 20% |

**Lab Reports (실습결과보고서)** must be submitted via the course LMS (Learning Management System) within one week of each lab session. Use the template in [Appendix D](appendix/report-template.md).

## Main Textbook

This lab manual is your primary course material (개인 강의 자료). Supplementary reading: *패킷트레이서를 이용한 네트워크 입문* (Introduction to Networks Using Packet Tracer).

## Lab Rules

1. **Save your work constantly.** Packet Tracer does not auto-save. Use **File → Save As** at the beginning of every session with the filename format `StudentID_ModuleN.pka`.
2. **Personalize your configurations.** Every module asks you to set your hostname to your name and use your student ID in IP addressing. Identical configurations across submissions will be treated as academic dishonesty.
3. **Document as you go.** Take screenshots at each step marked 📸 - you will need them for your lab report.
4. **Simulation Mode is your friend.** Use PT Simulation Mode (the clock icon) to watch packets travel hop-by-hop. Many lab questions require you to observe and explain packet behavior.
5. **No late reports without prior approval.** Lab reports lose 20% per day late.

## How Each Module is Structured

Every lab module follows the same template so you always know where you are:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Why This Matters** | The real-world problem this week's technology solves |
| **Learning Outcomes** | What you can do after the lab |
| **Pre-Lab** | Reading + questions to answer *before* class |
| **Equipment & Materials** | Software versions, any hardware needed |
| **Estimated Time** | Breakdown of session time |
| **Theory Review** | Concise concept summary, tied back to the motivation |
| **Guided Lab** | Step-by-step activity with observe-and-explain prompts |
| **Challenge Tasks** | Unguided extensions for those who finish early |
| **Deliverables** | Numbered checklist for your lab report |
| **Assessment Rubric** | How your report is graded |

## Week 8 Midterm - Format

The midterm is a **timed practical exam** (50 minutes) administered in Packet Tracer. You will be given a partially-configured network topology and must:

1. Diagnose what is broken (connectivity test will show failing pings)
2. Apply correct IOS commands to restore full connectivity
3. Submit your `.pka` file and a brief written explanation

Topics in scope: Modules 1–7 (everything before Week 8).
