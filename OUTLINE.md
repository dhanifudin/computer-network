# Outline: Intelligent Network Design (지능형네트워크설계)

Software Convergence 001, 한경국립대학교 Hankyong National University.
Instructor: Amalia. Department: School of Computer & Applied Mathematics.

Full pedagogical rules (chain-linking, slot structure) live in `SPINE.md`;
this file is the flat semester-level view. Full step-by-step lab content,
deliverables, and rubrics live in the book (`book/src/`) — this outline
covers the lecture decks only.

## Class Format

Each weekly session is 3×50-minute periods (150 min total): ~1 hour of
lecture/theory via the slide deck listed below, then ~2 hours of hands-on
lab via the matching book chapter. See `book/src/introduction.md`'s "Class
Format" section for the full breakdown.

1. **Orientation** — you can read a live host's diagnostic state and build a
   2-PC LAN, but you don't yet know what happens to a packet moving through
   OSI layers on a switch/router path → **W2**
2. **Network Review 1** — you can trace a packet layer by layer, but the router in
   your topology has no hostname, no password, nothing configured → **W3**
3. **Basic Config** — the router is hardened, but you don't yet know the
   vocabulary of `show` commands to diagnose it at 3 AM → **W4**
4. **IOS Management** — you can read a router's live state perfectly, but two
   sites still can't reach each other because nobody told the router how
   → **W5**
5. **Static Routing** — static routes connect two or three sites, but a
   network with dozens of buildings can't be hand-updated the moment a link
   dies at 3 AM → **W6**
6. **Dynamic Routing** — RIP/EIGRP find alternate paths automatically, but
   nothing stops an unauthorized source from reaching a vulnerable service in
   the first place → **W7**
7. **ACLs** — ACLs filter Layer 3 traffic between subnets, but they can't
   stop a broadcast storm inside one flat Layer 2 network → **W9**
   *(Week 8 midterm: no chain link)*
8. **VLANs** — VLANs isolate broadcast domains across campus switches, but
   connecting to a remote site over a WAN — with authentication, and enough
   public IPs for everyone — is a different problem → **W10**
9. **WAN: PPP & NAT** — PAT lets a whole office share one public IP outward,
   but a large multi-building campus still needs routing that converges
   faster and scales further than RIP/EIGRP → **W11**
10. **OSPF** — OSPF gets routes to every subnet in seconds, but none of those
    devices have an IP address until someone configures each one by hand
    → **W12**
11. **DHCP** — DHCP automates addressing for thousands of devices, but this
    course has only shown small topologies — the capstone project must
    design and defend a network at realistic scale → **W13–14**

## Running case study

Two-site company network, built up module by module: a single diagnosed
host (Module 1), layered packet tracing (Module 2), a hardened router pair
(Module 3), verified with `show` commands (Module 4), connected by static
then dynamic routing (Modules 5–6), secured with ACLs (Module 7), segmented
with VLANs (Module 9), extended over a WAN with NAT (Module 10), scaled with
OSPF (Module 11), and automated with DHCP (Module 12) — the same topology
family growing one capability per week toward the Week 13–14 capstone.

## Status

All 12 lecture decks (Introduction + Modules 1–7, 9–12) drafted, built, and
themed. Handout/worksheet/quiz materials are not yet authored — see the book
(`book/src/`) for full lab instructions, deliverables, and rubrics.
